# SQL 
### What is a Database (DB)?
 Any collection of related information
    1. Phone Book
    2. Shopping list
    3. Todo list
    4. Your 5 best friends 
    5. Facebook's user base, etc..
- Database can be stored in different ways
    1. On paper
    2. In your mind
    3. On a computer
    4. This Notion note on SQL itself
    5. Comment section
    
#  Database Management System (DBMS) : 
- A special software program that helps users to create and manage a database
    - makes its easy to manage large amount of infromation
    - handles security
    - backups
    - importing/exporting data
    - concurrency - In a database management system (DBMS), concurrency control manages simultaneous access to a database.
    - Interacts with software application
        - Programming languages

## CRUD

- CRUD (CREATE, READ/RETRIEVE, UPDATE, DELETE) is use to perform following functionalities - to create a database, read or retrieve informations from database, update the existing information database and delete the information in database.
- These are core 4 operations or functionalities in DBMS.

## Two Types of Databases

1. Relational databases (SQL)
    - Organize data into one or more tables
        - Each table has columns and rows
        - A unique key identifies each row

  2.  Non-Relational (no-SQL / not just SQL)

- Organize data in anything but a traditional table
    - Key-value stores
    - Documents(JSON, XML, etc.)
    - Graphs
    - Flexible table

## 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
    - Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.
- Structured Query Language
    - Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
    - Used to perform 4 core operations i.e. CRUD operations, as well as other administrative tasks(user management, security, backups, etc.).
    - Used to define tables and structures
    - SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification
- Example of Relational Database i.e. SQL  
    -  Below ID and Username is unique

## 2. Non-Relational Databases (noSQL, not just SQL)

- Non-Relational Database management System (NRDBMS)
    - Helps users to create and maintain a non-relational database
        - Example: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, Firebase, etc.
- Implementation specific
    - Any non-relational databases falls under this category, so there is no set of language standard.
    - Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing CRUD and administrative operations on databases.
- Example of Non-Relational Databases (noSQL, not just SQL) -
